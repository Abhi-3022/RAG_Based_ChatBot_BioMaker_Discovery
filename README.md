## üåü Features

- **Multi-PDF Processing**: Automatically processes multiple PDFs stored in a specified directory.
- **Biomedical Research Insights**: AI-powered question answering for biomarker discovery and analysis.
- **Efficient Text Processing**: Splits large research documents into manageable chunks for analysis.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Allows users to query documents interactively.
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Displays file metadata (e.g., name, size, number of documents).

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

This project assists researchers in extracting biomarkers or other critical insights from large collections of biomedical research documents. It leverages **LangChain** for text processing, **FAISS** for similarity searches, and **Google Generative AI** for embeddings and conversational capabilities.

## üì• Sample Input

**Example Question**:
> "What are the key biomarkers identified in these studies for cancer treatment?"

**PDF Directory**:
- `Study1.pdf` (1.2 MB)
- `Study2.pdf` (3.4 MB)

## üì§ Sample Output

**User Input**:
> "What biomarkers are associated with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease in the documents?"

**Assistant Output**:
> "The studies indicate that beta-amyloid plaques and tau proteins are key biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease. Additional markers include inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress indicators."

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or later.
2. A valid **Google API Key** with access to Google Generative AI.
3. A folder containing PDF files for processing (default: `BioMark/`).

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/biomarker-assistant.git
   cd biomarker-assistant
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   streamlit run app.py

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
### PDF Metadata Extraction:

- Extracts file names, sizes, and counts from the BioMark/ directory.
### Text Processing:

- Reads and combines text from all PDFs.
- Splits the text into chunks using LangChain‚Äôs RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
### Vector Store Creation:

- Generates embeddings using Google Generative AI.
- Creates and stores a FAISS index for similarity searches.
### Question Answering:

- Retrieves the most relevant text chunks for a given question.
- Uses a custom prompt to generate detailed responses.
## üëÄ Example Scenarios
- **Biomedical Research:** Query large collections of studies for biomarkers or treatment details.
- **Healthcare Analysis:** Extract insights from clinical trial reports.
- **Academic Use:** Quickly summarize or extract key information from published papers.
